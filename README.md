<h1>WP Starterkit with Gulp</h1>
<p>This is a Wordpress(4.7) Theme Starterkit for developing highly optimized WordPress themes with Gulp, npm, and Sass, among other tools. This is not meant to be a starter theme or framework. It is, instead, a kind of project scaffolding and example workflow for modern and efficient WordPress theme development.</p>

<p>The latest version of this starter kit features a modular Gulp file design. Configuration is isolated from the tasks themselves to make it easier to change paths and modify settings. Live local development is now facilitated by BrowserSync.</p>
